And yet another repository. 

Hello hello - 

My name is Niall McCarthy and I'm hoping that I can learn how to effectively code and that it could eventually be something more than just a passing interest!

Back again for round 2! Coding can change the world of labor and human sustainability, and I need to learn that path so that I can share it with others. If technology is to bear the brunt of human evolution, it behooves all of us to understand and have mastery over that technology.
